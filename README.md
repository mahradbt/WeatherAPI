# Weather App API with Authentication (Symfony, Docker)

This project provides a secure, RESTful backend API for a mobile weather application built with Symfony and Docker. Users can authenticate and access weather data and search functionalities through the API.


## Features

Authentication: Implements a secure authentication system for user access control.
RESTful API: Provides a well-defined API for weather data retrieval and search functions.
Symfony Framework: Leverages the robust features and libraries of Symfony for backend development.
Dockerized Environment: Ensures consistent and portable setup using Docker containers.


## Technologies

Backend: Symfony
Dockerization: Docker Compose
Database: MariaDB
Database Administration: phpMyAdmin (optional)
Cache: Redis (optional)
API Authentication: (Specify your chosen authentication method)
